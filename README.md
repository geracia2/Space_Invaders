# Space Invaders 

**This is my first project in Software Engineering!**

Space Invaders is a fixed shooter arcade game where the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. The objective is to pan across a screen and shoot descending swarms of aliens, preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen.

# Features
User can change the following:
- Change the number of aliens in a row.
- Change the number of rows.
- Change the speed of the game.
- Combine the previous three controls and produce a preset of _three difficulties._ 
- **Stretch Features**
- Power up items that change the ship's attack pattern.
- Add Sprites.
- Add Audio.

Sprits will change when interacting with certain items.

# Project Requirements
As this is a project from Per Scholas, the following are requirements I needed to adhere to.

### Mandatory
- Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (must be visual and use the DOM not the Console)
- Hosted on Github pages
- Commits to Github every day
- A README.md file

### Must Have Features
- **A win state** - a way for the player to win the game
    - High score can be considered a win state
- **A lose state** - a way for the player to lose the game
- A way to keep playing if the game is not over
- **Multiple rounds to play** - a round must begin, end and check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost.

### Stretch Goals
- A way to reset the board and play again
- CSS to give your game a personal and fun style
- Responsive mobile design
- Work with your instructor to determine additional stretch goals

# Tech
This project is meant to test my skills after 5 weeks of introductory programming. 

- HTML5
- Canvas
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- PhotoShop

# Installation / How to use?

# Credits
Some assets were created by me and others were sourced from the following:

# Known Bugs
- if pressing Space and or W, A; player breaks safe margin

# Approach
I wanted to combine my **_current knowledge_** as well as learn the following new things:
- canvas
- how to work with sprite sheets
- gravity
- sprite changes
- keyboard inputs
- sound

Majority of canvas learning came from MDN documentation and SpicyYogurt
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial
https://spicyyoghurt.com/tutorials/html5-javascript-game-development/images-and-sprite-animations

I've also set up a Notion board capturing all my learning.
